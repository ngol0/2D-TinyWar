# 2D Tiny War using ECS and MonoGame Framework

Tiny War is inspired by Plant Vs. Zombie. It is developed using C# and Monogame framework. It uses the ECS architecture from [MonoGame.Extended Libraries](https://www.monogameextended.net/docs/features/entities/entities/#destroying-entities) as the foundational structure.

It is currently under development and is expected to have all the basic UI and gameplay by late April 2024.
